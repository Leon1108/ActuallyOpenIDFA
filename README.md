ActuallyOpenIDFA for iOS


##Synopsis
A take on Yann Lechelle's "OpenIDFA": https://github.com/ylechelle/OpenIDFA But this one is actually open source.

##Should I use it?
Should you use this?  Not really sure, you should proably wait and see what happens....

##Use
Build the library for iOS and look at the header file.

## Rejected ideas
* GPS: requires permissions
* Accelerometer, compass: changes all the time
* advertisingTrackingEnabled Requires the ADSupport.framework
* UDID, MAC: deprecated
* UIPasteBoard: per app now
